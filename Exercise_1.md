**Understanding Traffic with Wireshark**

**Objectives:**

This exercise supports a discussion surrounding the use of Wireshark begins with
familiarization with the application and uses a traffic capture file (pcap) to
demonstrate investigating the OSI model and how encapsulated traffic is
communicated given different protocols.

**Step 1 : Open and explore the Wireshark application**

**(Windows-based installation)**

1.  After installation, open the Wireshark application. The first menu view will
    present the options of opening a previously captured stream of traffic
    (.pcap file format) or using Wireshark to start a new, live traffic capture.
    You may have different interface options than in the image as this depending
    on the hardware (network interface cards) associated with the computer where
    you are using Wireshark. See image below.

1.  We will use Wireshark to capture live traffic. Based on the computer YOU are
    using, select the network interface that shows active traffic (notice the
    graph that indicates activity; for this demonstration the Wi-Fi adapter will
    be selected.) Ensure the proper adapter is highlighted and select the blue
    shark fin icon at the top left hand side of the screen.

**Step 2 : Understand**

1.  The
