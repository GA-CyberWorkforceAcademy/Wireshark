What is Wireshark
=================

Wireshark is an open-source network packet analyzer that provides an easy to use
GUI interface. This packet analyzer can capture and present packet data in
detail, allowing you to see what is happening inside network communications.

Wireshark is an important tool for IT and Cybersecurity professionals but also
makes a great teaching tool. Professionals may use Wireshark to investigate
problems, analyst security incidents or verify network operations, but the depth
and detail that this tool provides make it appropriate for learning and
exploring network communications.

What can Wireshark do?
======================

The following are just a few of the many features of Wireshark:

-   Available for Windows, Mac or Linux computers

-   Capture live traffic from a network interface

-   Open files containing traffic captured with other packet capture programs
    (.pcap file format)

-   Display traffic with detailed protocol information

-   Export data or artifacts from traffic capture

-   Filter or search packets on many criteria

-   Create various statistics

System Requirements (Windows)
=============================

*Because traffic captures contain a bit-for-bit copy of the traffic and displays
this detail graphically, Wireshark can be resource intensive if large amounts of
traffic are being captured (like on a busy network) or displayed (from a very
large pcap file).*

Wireshark should support any version of Windows that is still within
its extended support lifetime. This includes Windows 10, 8.1, Server 2019,
Server 2016, Server 2012 R2, and Server 2012. It also requires the following:

-   The Universal C Runtime. This is included with Windows 10 and Windows Server
    2019 and is installed automatically on earlier versions if Microsoft Windows
    Update is enabled

-   Any modern 64-bit AMD64/x86-64 or 32-bit x86 processor

-   500 MB available RAM. Larger capture files require more RAM

-   500 MB available disk space. Capture files require additional disk space

-   A supported network card for capturing (Ethernet or wireless)
